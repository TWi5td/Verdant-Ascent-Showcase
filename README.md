# Verdant Ascent — Code Showcase
*Selected source samples from a private in‑development 3D parkour game built in Godot.*

This repository contains **curated excerpts** of gameplay systems, architecture patterns, and tools from my larger private project **Verdant Ascent** — a surreal 3D parkour exploration game about dream loops, shifting mazes, and symbolic environments.

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate **coding style**, **gameplay programming**, **Godot workflow**, and **architecture decisions** without exposing the full project or narrative content.

---

## About the Full Project (Private)
**Verdant Ascent** is a narrative, surreal, movement‑driven game currently in active development.  
Core themes include:
- Dreams and memory loops  
- World states that shift each iteration  
- Exploration of a recursive, evolving maze  
- Momentum‑based parkour traversal  

The full repo remains private while the game is under development.
